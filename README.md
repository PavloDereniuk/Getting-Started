# Getting-Started

Akash Network is a decentralized marketplace for cloud computing that allows developers to deploy their applications on an open, independent, and competitive platform. Instead of relying on traditional centralized solutions, Akash uses a decentralized model where server owners can offer their unused computing resources, and developers can rent them at competitive prices.
This approach provides a flexible, secure, and cost-effective cloud environment that operates without intermediaries or unnecessary restrictions.

# 1. Creating Your First Wallet

To interact with the Akash Network, you need a cryptocurrency wallet that supports Akash‚Äôs native token, AKT. To interact with the Akash Console, you will need one of the following wallets: Keplr, Leap or Cosmostation. In our example, we will install and use the Keplr wallet. You can also deposit money to your account using a credit card.

### Step 1: Install Keplr Wallet
1. Open Google Chrome.
3. Go to the Keplr Wallet Extension on the Chrome Web Store.

### Step 2: Create a New Wallet
1. Click the Keplr icon in your browser and select "Create New Account".
2. Keplr will generate a 12 or 24-word seed phrase.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Write this phrase down on paper and store it in a safe place.
* Never share your seed phrase! It is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose access.
3. Enter a wallet name and create a strong password.
4. Click "Next", confirm your seed phrase, and complete the setup.

### Step 3: Get Your Wallet Address
