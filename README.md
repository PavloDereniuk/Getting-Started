# Getting Started with Akash

**Akash Network** is a decentralized marketplace for cloud computing that revolutionizes how cloud resources are utilized by providing an open, independent, and competitive platform. Instead of relying on traditional centralized solutions, Akash uses a decentralized model where server owners can offer their unused computing resources, and developers can rent them at competitive prices. This approach provides a flexible, secure, and cost-effective cloud environment that operates without intermediaries or unnecessary restrictions. Here's a closer look at how it operates:

## 1. Creating Your First Crypto Wallet

### What is a Crypto Wallet?
To start using the Akash Network, you need a cryptocurrency wallet. (You can also add funds using a credit card, which we will discuss in the following sections.) A crypto wallet is a digital tool that stores your private keys, which are necessary to access and manage your cryptocurrency on the blockchain. It doesn‚Äôt hold the coins themselves but acts as a secure gateway to your funds, allowing you to send, receive, or stake them.

### Why Do You Need One?
A crypto wallet is essential for keeping your assets secure, protecting them from exchange vulnerabilities, and giving you full control over your cryptocurrency. It enables easy management and interaction with decentralized applications.

### Compatible Wallets for Akash Network
Several wallets support the AKT token used on Akash Network. Based on compatibility with the Cosmos ecosystem, these include:
- **Keplr**: A popular browser extension wallet, user-friendly and widely recommended.
- **Leap**: A simple and intuitive wallet designed for Cosmos users.
- **Cosmostation**: Available as a mobile app and web interface, supports AKT.

For this guide, we‚Äôll focus on setting up **Keplr**, a common choice for Akash Network users.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up Keplr Wallet
Follow these steps to create and configure your Keplr wallet for Akash Network:

- **Download and Install**  
   - Go to the official Keplr website ([keplr.app](https://www.keplr.app/)).  
   - Download the browser extension for Chrome or Firefox and follow the installation prompts.

- **Open Extension**  
   - Click the Keplr icon in your browser‚Äôs extension bar to launch the wallet interface.

- **Create Wallet**  
   - Select ‚ÄúCreate a new wallet‚Äù to begin the setup process.

- **Secure with Seed Phrase**  
   - Select "Create new recovery phrase". 
   - Keplr will generate a 12-word seed phrase. Write it down on paper and store it in a safe, offline location ‚Äî this is critical for recovering your wallet if needed.

- **Verify Seed Phrase**  
   - Re-enter the seed phrase words corresponding to the numbers displayed on the screen to confirm that you have saved them correctly.

- **Set Password and Wallet Name**  
   - Choose a convenient name for your wallet and enter it in the appropriate field.
   - Create a strong, unique password and confirm it to secure your wallet.

- **Select Supported Chains**
   - Select the chains you need. Initially, we recommend selecting all the available chains‚Äîyou can adjust these settings later.

‚úÖ Congratulations! You have successfully created your first Crypto Wallet. 

### Tips for Success
- Never share your seed phrase or password with anyone.
- Double-check the network when transferring AKT to avoid losing funds.
- Keep a backup of your seed phrase in a secure location.

Now, let's explore how to add funds to your wallet.

## **2. Getting AKT Tokens**  

AKT is the native token of the Akash Network and serves as the backbone of its decentralized ecosystem. It plays a fundamental role in various aspects of the network, including payments for resources, staking, governance, and liquidity.  

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at each function:  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Payments for Resources**  
AKT is used as a primary payment method in the Akash decentralized marketplace, where users rent cloud computing resources from providers. The price is determined by supply and demand, making cloud services more affordable and transparent.  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Staking and Rewards**  
AKT holders can stake their tokens by delegating them to validators, who process transactions and maintain the network. In return, delegators earn rewards, and validators are incentivized to participate actively in the ecosystem.  

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Governance and Decision-Making**  
AKT token holders who participate in staking can take part in on-chain governance, voting on proposals that influence network upgrades, economic parameters, and overall protocol development. This ensures a community-driven and decentralized decision-making process.  

Through these functions, AKT facilitates transactions, enhances decentralization, and supports the economic stability of Akash Network. üöÄ
